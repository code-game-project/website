# Creating the Project

## Discovering games

CodeGame provides many different games. All officially supported games are listed on [games.code-game.org](https://games.code-game.org).

For this guide we will choose _Number Guessing_ because it is the simplest game available, but still includes the most important features of CodeGame.

When you have chosen a game, you will need to copy its URL. In our case it is `games.code-game.org/number-guessing`.

## Creating the project template

To create any CodeGame project, you will execute the `new` command:

```bash
codegame new
```

Next, choose _Game Client_ as the _Project type_.

Now you will be prompted to enter a name for your project. We will use `guess-client`, but you are free to use another name as long as it only contains letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens.

When prompted for the _Game server URL_ enter `games.code-game.org/number-guessing`.

Then choose your favorite programming language and enter the language specific information.

At the end, you will be asked whether you want to initialize Git, create a README or select a license.

After you've followed all of the previous steps you can open the created `./guess-client` directory in your [code editor](setup#code-editor).
