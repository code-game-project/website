# Default Template

The default template provides you with enough code to join a game and start listening for events.

It exposes this functionality through a command line interface that is common to all CodeGame applications.

Every CodeGame application can be launched using `codegame run`.

## The default CLI

To create and join a new game:

```bash
codegame run create <username>
```

:::info
Add the `--public` flag to make the created game visible for everyone on the game server website, or
add the `--protected` flag to create an additional _join secret_ that is required to join the game.
:::

To join an existing game:

```bash
codegame run join <game_id> <username>
```

:::info
Add the `--spectate` flag to join the game as a spectator. Spectators receive all events from the game server but cannot send any commands and don't have a player associated to them.
:::

To reconnect to a previous session:

```bash
codegame run reconnect <username>
```

:::tip
A session is created automatically every time you join a game. You can view all of the current sessions with `codegame session list`.
Sessions allow for a smooth development experience because you can quickly reconnect to a previous game after making a some code changes by using the `reconnect` command.
:::

## Files

`codegame new` creates several files for you:
